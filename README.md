Console-Based Snake Game!

This was NOT my own code, I followed a tutorial. This was one of the first python projects I have ever done. It's a relatively simple O(n) program that plays the widely popular snake game in the console. After you create the gamespace (window) the program goes into a while loop that runs until you hit a border or itself. This is done by set of condtionals that compare the location of the "head" of the snake and making sure it hasn't hit the indexes of the border or any part of the window that contains a part of the snake. Once you find food and run into the food with the head of the snake, then the length of your snake is increased and a new food is placed within the bounds of the playspace and there is also a while loop that makes sure when it places a food item in the placespace that the place the food is going to be placed isn't occupied by the snake. Eating a food item also increases score which is displayed in the top left side of the playspace.
